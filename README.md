# What happened to my GitHub account?

<details>
<summary>2015 GH story</summary>

I've gone through different medical situations and ended up deleting several accounts in the internet, including GitHub ones. The only internet accounts I've not deleted/lost are my [DeviantArt](https://deviantart.com/hydroper) and [PHPBrasil](https://phpbrasil.com/profile/RMYiJhYbdir/matheus-dias-de-souza), which are from the 2014 and 2015 years respectively. (In a certain way, I still have my first Steam account basically loggable as well, but it's a bit inaccessible.)

[Here's one example question I asked in StackOverflow in 2015.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31146403/how-to-make-url-clear) (As you can see, my written English was a little poor as I'm not a native speaker.)

Why did I delete them? I was feeling faulty of content I used to consume; the accounts were an island of different contents, and after a doctor prescribed me a medication I started to have convulsions, feeling insecure.

My first GH account was around 2015 december (the era in which I used to call myself "Hand on Cloud" and rarely Hydroper/Klaider Klai). I've not anything anymore to show, except 2019 things like the [alien.as](https://github.com/alien-as) organisation.

This GH account contains newer works; the previous GH account (still not the very old one) is just [hydroper](https://github.com/hydroper), but I lost its 2FA access.

I started learning dev stuff in the 2014's even, or pratically 2015's beginning.

No clear thoughts as to whether the multi-media framework called "Whack" will be worked on. You may look at the [ShockScript](https://github.com/shockscript) organisation for the scripting language that it wants to support.
